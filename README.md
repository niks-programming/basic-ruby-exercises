# basic-ruby-exercises
This is a repo for me to house my basic ruby exercises from the odin project!

In this repo you will find four different folders, each containing a different project. 
However each project will be detailed here:

1 - Caesar Cipher
The goal of this project is to take a string and a shift amount and then to return the properly shifted string.
Example ("Hello", 2) --> "Jgnnq" 


2 - Substring Method
The goal of this project is to take in a string and then an array of substrings and to return a hash
where each substring is a key and the value is how many times its counted in the string.
Example func("Hello", ["Hell", "lo", "l"]) --> {"Hell" => 1, "lo" => 1, "l" => 2}
