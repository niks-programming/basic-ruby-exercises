# basic-ruby-exercises
This is a repo for me to house my basic ruby exercises from the odin project!

In this repo you will find four different folders, each containing a different project. 
However each project will be detailed here:

1 - Caesar Cipher
The goal of this project is to take a string and a shift amount and then to return the properly shifted string.
Example ("Hello", 2) --> "Jgnnq"
